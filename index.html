This article will briefly explain the long-lasting history of the Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). The ICE has been powering the world for centuries, really becoming big in 
the 1860’s <a href ="#References">(Starr, FS (2012) Development of the Poppet Type Exhaust Valve in the Internal Combustion Engine: Part I 1860–1930)</a>. I will discuss the basic operation of the ICEs 
and compare the types, showing how they differ in power, efficiency and impact on the environment. As the latter part of my title suggests I will go into detail over the 
present and future of the ICEs. As they are forced to become more efficient, as the need to combat climate change increases. This will be shown in the format of a table to 
clearly highlight the differences.

Internal combustions Engines (ICE) come in 2 main forms 2–stroke and 4-engines. They share parts within the engines, for example they both have a piston, crank case and cylinder 
etc. The way a 4-stroke operates is it starts with the induction strike; this is where a piston goes down the cylinder and draws in air mixed with fuel. Then follows the 
compression stroke. All valves are closed, and the piston rises causing ignition, after this the working stroke which raises the pressure and temperature. Finally, the exhaust 
stroke, which “expels” the gases. (Stone, RS (2012) Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines). The 2-stroke engine operates in a much shorter way. It includes the compression
stroke and the working stroke. The 4-stroke cycle is commonly referred to as “suck, squeeze, bang and blow”. <a href="#References">(Stone, RS (2012) Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines)</a> ICEs 
use these continued and controlled ignitions to create a force, which then powers the engines parts and makes everything work. Using pressure and gases in the process.

As highlighted in my abstract the demand to make things more efficient is always increasing. Internal combustion engines are huge producers of greenhouse gases, due to them being powered by diesel and 
gas, which contribute to high consumption use. However, with the help of advancements Interanl combustion engines are aiming to continue to power our world. There are many different strategies proposed by engineers and
governments to make Internal combustion engines more environmentally friendly and efficient. I will be discussing two in this article, but this is in no way the limits to our future advancements. 
Low – temperature Combustion is one of the ways of improving thermal efficiency. It includes “improved mixture preparation fuel atomization, reduced combustion”. These in theory 
will help to decrease emissions but also improving thermal efficiency. Another interesting way of improving efficiency is using a “Laser Ignition System”. This system decreases 
combustion duration and heightens combustion efficiency, as the combustion doesn’t continue when it is no longer needed. <a href="#References">(Dahham, RD (2022) Improving Thermal Efficiency of 
Internal Combustion Engines: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges)</a>.

99.8 % of global transport in 2020 was powered by ICEs (LEACH, FL et al (2020) The scope for improving the efficiency and environmental impact of internal combustion engines). 
This is how ICEs have a such a huge environmental impact and why there is so many challenges in improving them. As ICEs are used in almost forms of travel and are clearly 
fit for purpose the alternatives are far behind. The alternatives if rushed can have disastrous impacts on the environment and socially. The transport industry causes 25% of 
global CO2 emissions. Therefore, by default ICEs are a huge contributor to CO2 emissions. <a href="#References">(LEACH, FL et al (2020) The scope for improving the efficiency and environmental 
impact of internal combustion engines)</a>.

Table 1 highlights the comparison between the two-stroke and four-stroke engines, emphasising how different designes are suited for specific application. For example
two-stroke engines offer higher power relative to weight, whereas the four-stroke with its lower emissions and high fuel efficieny is more suited for vehicles. The
differences highlighted in the table, using Richard Stone's book, show the importance of matching engine design to the application. This reduces the negative impacts
on the environment and improves efficiency.
      
My conclusion after conducting my research on Internal Combustion Engines is that ICEs are here to stay for a few more years. I believe this to be the case as so many
manmade machines rely heavily on the ICEs. They will continue to do so as highlighted in my article it explains how the alternatives are still far behind. However, I 
now hold the believe, due to my research, that we must find solutions in decreasing the ICEs impact on the environment and greenhouse emissions. Hopefully my article 
gives you some level of confidence as ideas are being constantly discussed and experimented on. Also, the comparison between the 2 stroke and 4 stroke highlights the 
importance of having different types if ICEs. For example, the 4-stroke can power larger vehicles and has less emissions. If only the 2-stroke existed multiple would 
be needed to power the car and as they have higher emissions the effect on the environment would dramatically increase. Finally, this research left me amazed that in
an era, where innovation seems to be occurring at an ever-increasing rate, the humble Internal Combustion Engine has survived the test of time. For better or for 
worse, that is still up for discussion.
