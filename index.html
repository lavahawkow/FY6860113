My conclusion after conducting my research on Internal Combustion Engines is that ICEs are here to stay for a few more years. I believe this to be the case as so many manmade machines rely heavily on the ICEs. They will 
continue to do so as highlighted in my article it explains how the alternatives are still far behind. However, I now hold the believe, due to my research, that we must find solutions in decreasing the ICEs impact on the 
environment and greenhouse emissions. Hopefully my article gives you some level of confidence as ideas are being constantly discussed and experimented on. Also, the comparison between the 2 stroke and 4 stroke highlights
the importance of having different types if ICEs. For example, the 4-stroke can power larger vehicles and has less emissions. If only the 2-stroke existed multiple would be needed to power the car and as they have higher
emissions the effect on the environment would dramatically increase. Finally, this research left me amazed that in an era, where innovation seems to be occurring at an ever-increasing rate, the humble Internal Combustion
Engine has survived the test of time. For better or for worse, that is still up for discussion.
