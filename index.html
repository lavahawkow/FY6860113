This article will briefly explain the long-lasting history of the Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). The ICE has been powering the world for centuries, really becoming big in the 1860’s (Starr, FS (2012) Development
of the Poppet Type Exhaust Valve in the Internal Combustion Engine: Part I 1860–1930). I will discuss the basic operation of the ICEs and compare the types, showing how they differ in power, efficiency and impact on 
the environment. As the latter part of my title suggests I will go into detail over the present and future of the ICEs. As they are forced to become more efficient, as the need to combat climate change increases. This 
will be shown in the format of a table to clearly highlight the differences.

Internal combustions Engines (ICE) come in 2 main forms 2–stroke and 4-engines. They share parts within the engines, for example they both have a piston, crank case and cylinder etc. The way a 4-stroke operates is it 
starts with the induction strike; this is where a piston goes down the cylinder and draws in air mixed with fuel. Then follows the compression stroke. All valves are closed, and the piston rises causing ignition, after 
this the working stroke which raises the pressure and temperature. Finally, the exhaust stroke, which “expels” the gases. (Stone, RS (2012) Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines). The 2-stroke engine operates in a 
much shorter way. It includes the compression stroke and the working stroke. The 4-stroke cycle is commonly referred to as “suck, squeeze, bang and blow”. (Stone, RS (2012) Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines) 
ICEs use these continued and controlled ignitions to create a force, which then powers the engines parts and makes everything work. Using pressure and gases in the process. (Zhu, HZ, et al (2023) Study on combustion and 
emission characteristics of a micro- rotary cam internal combustion engine).

My conclusion after conducting my research on Internal Combustion Engines is that ICEs are here to stay for a few more years. I believe this to be the case as so many manmade machines rely heavily on the ICEs. They will 
continue to do so as highlighted in my article it explains how the alternatives are still far behind. However, I now hold the believe, due to my research, that we must find solutions in decreasing the ICEs impact on the 
environment and greenhouse emissions. Hopefully my article gives you some level of confidence as ideas are being constantly discussed and experimented on. Also, the comparison between the 2 stroke and 4 stroke highlights
the importance of having different types if ICEs. For example, the 4-stroke can power larger vehicles and has less emissions. If only the 2-stroke existed multiple would be needed to power the car and as they have higher
emissions the effect on the environment would dramatically increase. Finally, this research left me amazed that in an era, where innovation seems to be occurring at an ever-increasing rate, the humble Internal Combustion
Engine has survived the test of time. For better or for worse, that is still up for discussion.
